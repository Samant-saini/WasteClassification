Title: Waste Classification with Streamlit and OpenCV

Description:

This project tackles the challenge of waste classification for biodegradable and non-biodegradable materials, empowering users to dispose of waste responsibly. It leverages the power of Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface and OpenCV for image processing and classification.

Key Features:

Image Classification: Uploads an image containing waste material.
Prediction: Accurately predicts whether the waste is biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
Disposal Instructions: Provides clear disposal guidelines based on the classification.
Dumping Area Locations: Integrates with a map service (consider options like Google Maps API) to pinpoint nearby disposal locations for both waste types.
